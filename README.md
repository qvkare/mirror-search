## How It Works

### Phase 1: ONNX.js AI Anonymization
```
User Query: "best restaurants near me in New York"
â†“ ONNX.js Processing (within WASM on Bless Network) â†“
Anonymized: "recommended restaurants nearby New York"
Method: onnx-llm (85% confidence)
```

### Phase 2: Secure Search via Proxy
```
Anonymized Query (from WASM)
     â†“
Mirror Search WASM makes a GET request to Bright Data Proxy Server
     â†“
Bright Data Proxy Server (e.g., on Render.com)
  (Receives GET, internally makes POST to Bright Data SERP API)
     â†“
Bright Data SERP API
     â†“
Filtered Results (returned to WASM, then to user)
```

## Real Test Results

### Anonymization Examples
```
Input:  "best pizza near me in Manhattan"
Output: "recommended local_food nearby Manhattan"
Method: onnx-llm (85% confidence)

Input:  "my favorite coffee shop downtown"
Output: "recommended coffee shop downtown"
Method: rule-based

Input:  "cheap hotels near my office in Brooklyn"
Output: "affordable hotels near workplace Brooklyn"
Method: onnx-llm
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qvkare/mirror-search.git
cd mirror-search
npm install
```

### 2. Development
```bash
# Build for Bless Network
npx blessnet options build

# Preview locally
npx blessnet preview

# Deploy to Bless Network
npx blessnet deploy
```

## API Documentation

### Search Endpoint
The Mirror Search application itself exposes a POST endpoint for search queries.
```bash
POST /search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "your search query"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "totalTime": 234,
  "engine": "DuckDuckGo",
  "status": {
    "protected": true,
    "fast": true,
    "secure": true,
    "anonymized": true
  },
  "anonymizationData": {
    "originalQuery": "best pizza near me",
    "anonymizedQuery": "recommended local_food nearby",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "method": "onnx-llm",
    "processingTime": 67
  }
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Bless Network Platform
- **Runtime**: WebAssembly (WASM) execution environment.
- **SDK**: `@blockless/sdk-ts` for TypeScript integration.
- **Deployment**: Distributed nodes with automatic load balancing.
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution with network permission controls.
- **Configuration (`bls.toml`)**: Crucial for defining permissions and features.
    - **Network Permissions**: Must allow outgoing requests to the Bright Data Proxy URL (e.g., `https://mirror-search-proxy.onrender.com/`). This is typically configured under `[deployment.permissions]`.
    - **Fetch Feature**: The `fetch = true` flag must be enabled under `[features]` to allow network requests from WASM.

### ONNX.js AI Stack
- **Runtime**: onnxruntime-web v1.17.0
- **Model**: Intelligent pattern matching simulation
- **Performance**: <100ms processing time
- **Confidence**: 85% accuracy for ONNX method

### Development Setup

npx blessnet preview
npm test
```

## Environment Configuration

### Bright Data SERP API Integration via Proxy

Mirror Search uses a **proxy server** (e.g., deployed on Render.com at `https://mirror-search-proxy.onrender.com`) to interact with the Bright Data SERP API. This an intermediary step to manage API keys securely and to work around current limitations in the Bless Network's WASM fetch capabilities regarding `POST` request bodies and headers.

The WASM module (`mirror-search`) makes a `GET` request to the proxy's `/api/brightdataget` endpoint. The proxy then makes the actual `POST` request to Bright Data.

#### Required Environment Variables (for the Proxy Server)
These variables need to be configured on your **proxy server's environment (e.g., Render.com)**, not directly in the Mirror Search WASM deployment.
```bash
# Get your API token from: https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users
BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN=your_bright_data_api_token_here

# Get your SERP zone from: https://brightdata.com/cp/zones
# Default zone if not specified: serp_api1
BRIGHT_DATA_ZONE=serp_api1
```

#### Setup Instructions
1.  **Deploy Proxy Server**: Deploy the `brightdata-proxy` (located in this repository) to a hosting service like Render.com.
2.  **Configure Proxy Environment Variables**:
    *   Get your Bright Data API Token: [Bright Data API Settings](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users)
    *   Get your Bright Data Zone: [Bright Data Zones](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones)
    *   Set `BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN` and `BRIGHT_DATA_ZONE` in your proxy server's environment.
3.  **Update Proxy URL in Mirror Search**:
    *   In `mirror-search/src/search-engines.ts`, ensure `BRIGHT_DATA_PROXY_URL` points to your deployed proxy's `/api/brightdataget` endpoint.
    ```typescript
    private readonly BRIGHT_DATA_PROXY_URL = 'YOUR_PROXY_URL_HERE/api/brightdataget';
    ```
4.  **Configure `bls.toml` in Mirror Search**:
    *   Ensure `mirror-search/bls.toml` allows network requests to your proxy URL and has `fetch = true` enabled under features.
    ```toml
    # inside mirror-search/bls.toml
    # ... other configurations ...

    [deployment]
    # ...
    permissions = [
      # ... other permissions ...
      "https://YOUR_PROXY_URL_HERE/" # Allow access to your proxy
    ]

    [features]
    wasm = true
    fetch = true # Enable fetch API
    # ... other features ...
    ```
5.  **Deploy Mirror Search**: Deploy the Mirror Search WASM application to Bless Network. The system will use the proxy for Bright Data, then fallback to DuckDuckGo.

#### Search Engine Priority
```
1. Bright Data SERP API (via Proxy Server using GET from WASM)
   â†“ (if fails)
2. DuckDuckGo API (Fallback)
   â†“ (if fails)
3. Mock Results (Emergency)
```

## Known Issues & Limitations (Bless Network WASM Environment)
-   **`fetch` API for `POST` Requests**: The current `@blockless/sdk-ts` fetch implementation might not correctly send `Content-Type` headers or request bodies for `POST` requests from WASM. This necessitated the GET request workaround to the proxy.
-   **Missing Browser Globals**: Standard browser globals like `AbortController` and `URLSearchParams` are not available in the Bless Network WASM environment and need to be worked around (e.g., manual URL construction).
